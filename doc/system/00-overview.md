# Overview

**Document version:** 1.1

System identity, role, and boundary with the rest of the Forge ecosystem.

## Doctrine

VibeForge is local-first by default, cloud-accelerated by approval, and developer-authoritative at every irreversible boundary.

VibeForge is not an IDE replacement, not a model wrapper, and not a cloud coding bot. It is a governed AI engineering command system that surrounds existing coding tools with local repo truth, context control, agent workcells, board review, patch receipts, command gates, privacy-safe cloud escalation, and developer authority.

VibeForge does not compete with coding models. VibeForge governs them.

## Agent principle

Agents may propose. Boards may recommend. SMITH may gate. Developers decide. Receipts prove.

Nothing is trusted because it was generated. A claim is trusted only when it has evidence, a contract, validation, a receipt, and an authority decision behind it.

## Naming boundary (non-negotiable)

This is the single most important boundary in the whole system, and the one this document exists to make unambiguous:

- The bundled local Postgres store is the **VibeForge Local Evidence Vault** (also "VibeForge Vault" or "VibeForge Local Authority Store"). It is customer-side, private, and owns all sensitive engineering evidence: repo truth, agent runs, context packs, board reviews, receipts, AAR records, and local policy.
- **Cloud DataForge** is a separate, company-side (BDS-internal) system. It receives only privacy-safe operational analytics — usage counts, route class, credit cost, success/failure, error category, app/OS version, quota events. It never receives source code, prompts, diffs, raw logs, secrets, file paths, or repo/branch names.
- The local vault must **never** be called "DataForge" or "DataForge Local" in any commercial-facing string, generated file, or new code. See "Known naming debt" below for where this rule is already being violated in this repo today.
- Internal Forge component names (SMITH, YellowJacket, PCC, PACT, Rake, NeuronForge, NeuroForge, ForgeAgents) stay out of the commercial product UI. Capability-level language only (see [01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md) for the full component role map).

## Non-goals

VibeForge is explicitly **not**:

- A general-purpose coding agent or a competitor to the coding models it wraps.
- A place where AI output is silently applied — every risky or irreversible action requires developer approval (Human-On-The-Loop, not autonomous).
- A cloud-first product — cloud is an opt-in escalation lane with a mandatory preview, credit estimate, and redaction pass before every job, never an ownership lane.
- A source of canonical Forge-ecosystem-wide governance, credential brokerage, or command-plane authority — those remain owned elsewhere (see [01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md), "Forge_Command").
- A rebuild of Canva/Adobe Express/a generic editor, or of ForgeCustomer/admin/fleet-update business logic borrowed in spirit but not in code from Forge_Command.

## Known naming debt

Live source in this repo already uses "DataForge" for what the doctrine above calls the "VibeForge Local Evidence Vault":

```text
src/lib/types/dataforge.ts
src/lib/stores/dataforgeStore.ts
src/lib/api/dataforge.ts
src/lib/core/api/dataforgeClient.ts
src/lib/core/api/dataforgeClient.enhanced.ts
src/lib/core/api/dataforgeClient.enhanced.test.ts
```

This code predates the naming doctrine above and is **not** an example to copy. It is not renamed as part of this documentation pass — that is a deferred, later-phase change, tracked as accepted, documented naming debt rather than left as an unstated inconsistency. New code must use "VibeForge Local Evidence Vault" naming; it must not extend the `dataforge*` pattern.

## Completion language

Allowed: planned, implemented, validated, partially implemented, blocked, accepted limitation, deferred, unproven.

Avoid, unless backed by executable evidence and an audit trail: production ready, fully safe, final, no risk, complete, SLSA compliant, SOC2 ready, HIPAA compliant, fully autonomous coder, AI replaces developer, perfect security.
