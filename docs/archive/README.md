# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation files that have been consolidated into the main documentation.

## Why These Files Are Archived

These files were created during the development process and contain valuable historical information, but their content has been consolidated into the main documentation for better organization and maintainability.

## Main Documentation

The current, consolidated documentation can be found in the root directory:

- **[README.md](../../README.md)** - Project overview, quick start, and navigation
- **[SETUP.md](../../SETUP.md)** - Installation and configuration guide
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical architecture and design patterns
- **[FEATURES.md](../../FEATURES.md)** - Feature documentation and user guides
- **[DEVELOPMENT.md](../../DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Development workflow and contribution guide
- **[TESTING.md](../../TESTING.md)** - Testing procedures and checklists
